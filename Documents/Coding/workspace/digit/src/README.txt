Questions:
Boys2008: A lot more lower numbers than higher numbers as the first and second digits of Boys' numbers.
The third digit seems to be more evenly distributed among all numbers, with a slight preference of the digit 2.
Many numbers in "boys" do not have a fourth digit; however, those that do have a fourth digit tend a bit more to the 2's and 3's.
96% of numbers in "boys" do not have a fifth digit.

Cities: As with "boys," the first and second digits in cities tend to be lower numbers like 0, 1, and 2 than higher numbers.
The third digit is more evenly distributed.  8 and 9 still don't show up too much, and numbers 1, 3, and 7 are favored.
The fourth digit is again more evenly distributed; there is some variation but for the most part every number is seen at about the same rate.
The fifth digit is less evenly distributed than the fourth; numbers 1, 8, and 9 are favored slightly more than the rest.
The sixth digit is even less evenly distributed; numbers 0, 1, 6, and 9 show up twice as much as 8 does.
Most numbers don't have more than 6 digits.

Girls 2008: The first digit of "girls" is much more often a lower digit number than a high one; 0, 1, 2, and 3 are favored.
The second digit is fairly evenly distributed among all numbers; with slightly more 0's, 6's, and 7's and less 4's and 5's.
The third digit is about as evenly distributed as the second digits; this time, 2 and 6 are emphasized while 1 and 5 are not.
69% of numbers in "girls" do not have a fourth digit; those that do have their digit almost evenly distributed among numbers 1-9.
98% of numbers in "girls" do not have a fifth digit.

Library Books: The first digit of the numbers is most likely to b a 1, and least likely to be a 9.  The trend continues for all numbers in between.
The second digit is the same, except the discrepancy between the likelihood of different numbers is less.
The third digit and fourth digits are pretty evenly distributed, with a slightly higher tendency for the digit to be 0.
Many numbers do not have a fifth or sixth digit; for those that do, the digit is almost equally likely to be any number.
Hardly any numbers have a seventh digit.

LiveJournal: LiveJournal's numbers' first digits are most likely to be a 1, then a 7, then a 6, 8, 2, or 9.  There is hardly any chance they will be a 3-5.
The second digit is most likely to be a low number and least likely to be a high number.
The third digit is pretty evenly distributed among all numbers, with a higher likelihood for the digit to be 0 than other numbers.
This is the same with the fourth and fifth digits, except there is a much higher likelihood for the digit to be 0 or for the number to not have a fourth digit, and an even higher likelihood for the fifth digit.
No numbers have a 6th digit.

NC Schools: The first digit of NC schools heavily favors 2, then 1, then 5.
On the other hand, the second digit is more often 4, then 5, then 8.
The third digit is more evenly distributed; still, there are no 0's or 4's.
The fourth digit favors 0's, and there are no 2-4's.
More often than not, the fifth digit will either be a 0, or there will be no 5th digit.
No numbers have over 5 digits.

Rand: For the digits of rand, there are significantly less 0's than the rest of the numbers.  1-9 are evenly distributed, however.

Sunspots: The first digit of sunspots is often a 1 or another small number except 0, which is very rare.
The second and third digits is often 0's; the possibilities of 1-9 are about equal.
There are never more than 3 digits.

Impressions: I thought that the assignment was pretty straightforward and did help us learn java better, especially the Scanner, String, and ArrayList classes.
The one problem that I think we could've been taught to better deal with was how to get rid of the words in parentheses; this gave me a lot of trouble and I had to consult many people.
Also, the questions on the assignment, while a bit interesting, seem like they could be more clear and require less extensive and less tedious work.
